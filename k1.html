<p>Mike, it’s been great seeing the traction on the channel. To take “No Losses,<br>
Just Lessons” to the next level, I’ve redesigned my production workflow.</p>

environment to you—saving you the time and hassle of traveling to a studio.<br>
Below are the updated tiers for our next phase of work.</p>

<h3 id="comparison--negotiation">Comparison &amp; Negotiation</h3>
<p>Mike, the <strong>Elite Package</strong> is modeled after top-tier Tampa production rates<br>
but bundled to give you the best ROI. However, I value our partnership above<br>
all else.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to do a batch of episodes or want to adjust specific<br>
deliverables to fit a certain budget, <strong>I’m open to a conversation to find<br>
a number that works for both of us.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s get the next session on the calendar—which tier works best for your<br>
goals right now?</p>
